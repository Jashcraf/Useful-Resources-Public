# Material Selection

# Lubricant

# Torque

Simplest approach:
Look up fastener clamping load and recommended torque on a table like the [Spaenaur Suggested Tightening] (spaenaur%20-%20Suggested%20Tightening%20Torque1%20Values%20To%20Produce%20Cor.pdf] chart.


# Inserts

 Nitronic 60 locking helical inserts are suggested for threading into aluminum. Inserts, such as locking helical inserts "helicoils", provide a locking mechanism to prevent screws from backing out, can increase strength, and the numbers of cycles of a joint.
